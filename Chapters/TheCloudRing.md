<h3 id="aws">AWS CLI Intro</h3>

You may not know this, but AWS CLI help messages are very easy to access. First, try typing: aws help. Next, please configure the default aws cli credentials: From here I would reference [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) for steps on configuring the console. The command used would be aws configure.

Excellent! To finish, please get your caller identity using the aws command line. The command used would be `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

<h3 id="search">Trufflehog Search</h3>

Use Trufflehog to find secrets in a Git Repo. Work with Jill Underpole in the Cloud Ring. What's the name of the file that has AWS Credentials? After some searching on the Gitlab websites repo I was able to find the file that had the credentials which is `put_policy.py`.

<h3 id="exploit">Exploitation via AWS CLI</h3>

Use Trufflehog to find credentials in the Gitlab instance at [asnowball](https://haugfactory.com/orcadmin/aws_scripts). Configure these credentials for `us-east-1` and then run the command. The command that I used was `git clone https://haugfactory.com/asnowball/aws_scripts.git`. I was able to clone the repo with git clone and open the directory showing the files inside.

![image4](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image4.jpg "Commands: git clone https://haugfactory.com/asnowball/aws_scripts.git | cd aws_scripts | ls")

This is the syntex on how to use Trufflehog: `trufflehog git <repo>`. Next would be using the command `trufflehog git https://haugfactory.com/asnowball/aws_scripts.git` and see what response we will get from the command. 

![image5](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image5.jpg "Command: trufflehog git https://haugfactory.com/asnowball/aws_scripts.git")

After using Trufflehog, I ended up using the Gitlab site that was provided in order to find the commit history that was needed.

![image7](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image7.jpg "put_policy.py credentials need for configuring aws")

After finding the commit put_policy.py I was able to get the `aws_access_key_id="AKIAAIDAYRANYAHGQOHD‚Äù` and `aws_secret_access_key="e95qToloszIgO9dNBsQMQsc5/foiPdKunPJwc1rL"`. With this information I will be able to configure the aws. With the command aws configure. From here I would input the AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Once that was done the next command, I will need to use is `aws sts get-caller-identity` to verify that the information was inputted correctly.

Managed (think:shared) policies can be attached to multiple users. Use the AWS CLI to find any policies attached to your user. The command that I used was `aws iam list-user-policies --user-name haug`.

![image9](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image9.jpg "Command: aws iam list-user-policies --user-name haug")

The following command used to get the policy for the user haug with the policy named `S3Perms`. `aws iam get-user-policy --user-name haug --policy-name S3Perms`.

![image10](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image10.jpg "Command: aws iam get-user-policy --user-name haug --policy-name S3Perms")

The next command used is to get a list of attached user policies under the name of haug. `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name haug`.

![image11](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image11.jpg "Command: aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name haug")

After some digging around on __AWS Command Reference__, I was able to come up with a command to spit out the policy needed. The command used was `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name haug`. Now we can view the git policy that is attached to the user haug. The command that was used to get policy was `aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::602123424321:policy/TIER1_READONLY_POLICY`

![image12](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image12.jpg "Command: aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::602123424321:policy/TIER1_READONLY_POLICY")

Attached policies can have multiple versions. View the default version of this policy. The command that I was able to come with the get the version of the policy from the prior information I was able to use this command. `aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::602123424321:policy/TIER1_READONLY_POLICY --version-id v1 | less`

![image13](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image13.jpg "Command: aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:aim::602123424321:policy/TIER1_READONLY_POLICY --version-id v1 | less | page 1")

![image14](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image14.jpg "Command: aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:aim::602123424321:policy/TIER1_READONLY_POLICY --version-id v1 | less | page 2")

The inline user policy name S3Perms disclosed the name of an S3 bucket that you have permissions to list objects. List those objects! The command used in order to get the bucket attached to S3Perms is `aws s3api list-object --bucket smogmachines3 | less`.

![image15](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image15.jpg "Command: aws s3api list-object --bucket smogmachines3 | less.| page 1")

![image16](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image16.jpg "Command: aws s3api list-object --bucket smogmachines3 | less.| page 2")

![image17](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image17.jpg "Command: aws s3api list-object --bucket smogmachines3 | less.| page 3")

The attached user policy provided you several Lambda privileges. Use the AWS CLI to list Lambda functions. In order to do that I would need to use the command `aws lambda list-functions | less`.

![image18](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image18.jpg "Command: aws lambda list-functions | less | page 1")

![image19](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image19.jpg "Command: aws lambda list-functions | less | page 2")

Use the AWS CLI to get the configuration containing the public URL of the Lambda function. I was able to come up with a command in order to get the public URL within the function it-self using `aws lambda get-function-url-config --function-name smogmachine_lambda`.

![image20](https://github.com/visionthex/SANS2022-Holiday-Hack-Challange/blob/main/Images/TheCloudRingImages/image20.jpg "Command: aws lambda get-function-url-config --function-name smogmachine_lambda")

The public URL that was found is `https://rxgnav37qmvqxtakes1w5vwwjm0suhwc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/`
