Five Rings for the Christmas king immersed in cold
Each Ring now missing from its zone
The first with bread kindly given, not sold
Another to find 'ere pipelines get owned
One beneath a fountain where water flowed
Into clouds Grinchum had the fourth thrown
The fifth on blockchains where shadows be bold
One hunt to seek them all, five quests to find them
One player to bring them all, and Santa Claus to bind them
