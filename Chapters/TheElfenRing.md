<h3 id="clone">Clone with a Difference</h3>

We just need you to clone one repo: `git clone git@haugfactory.com:asnowball/aws_scripts.git` this should be easy, right? This is:it does not seem to be working for me. This is a public repository through. I'm so confused! Please clone the repo and cat the READ.md file for me. To do this properly I will need to use the right syntax in order to clone the repository. `git clone <repository-url> <directory>` The command used is `git clone http://haugfactory.com/asnowball/aws`

Once the repo was cloned, I was able to go into the directory and find the README.md file. Here, I am able to cat or nano into the file and read its contents. Using the cat command, I was able to see what the last word within the contents which was Maintainer. `Command: cat README.md`.
